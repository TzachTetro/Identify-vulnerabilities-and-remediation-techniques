# Identify-vulnerabilities-and-remediation-techniques


## Purpose of the Project

The purpose of this project is to identify and address vulnerabilities within a system to enhance its overall security posture. This project focuses on detecting common and critical vulnerabilities, analyzing their potential impact, and implementing effective remediation techniques. By employing a combination of automated tools and manual assessments, the project aims to provide a comprehensive evaluation of security weaknesses and offer practical solutions to mitigate these risks.


## Features

- Automated Vulnerability Scanning: Utilizes Google Cloud Security Command Center and other tools to automatically scan and detect vulnerabilities in GCP resources and configurations.

- Comprehensive Risk Assessment: Analyzes the severity and potential impact of identified vulnerabilities, providing detailed risk assessments and prioritization for remediation.

- Detailed Remediation Guidelines: Offers step-by-step instructions and best practices for addressing and mitigating identified vulnerabilities, tailored to GCP services and configurations.

- Custom Alerting and Notification: Configures alerts for new vulnerabilities or changes in risk status, integrating with Google Cloud Monitoring to keep stakeholders informed.

- Compliance Checks: Ensures that security configurations align with industry standards and regulatory requirements by integrating tools like Google Cloud Security Command Center for compliance monitoring.

- Security Posture Dashboard: Provides a centralized view of the system's security status, including detected vulnerabilities, their risk levels, and the progress of remediation efforts.
